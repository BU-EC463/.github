# PAPO
#### Facilitating drug procurement

## Goal
The current manual and time-consuming drug procurement processes at the client's facility, characterized by the need for constant evaluation of drug alternatives based on price, quantity, and packaging, along with the critical need for timely and precise drug restocking, significantly hinder operational efficiency and patient care. To solve this we produced a standalone cloud based application that will produce accurate replacement drugs and a cost analysis for them based on an input drug identification number.

## How it works
The PAPO application is a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to optimize the pharmaceutical procurement process through advanced technology. It integrates a secure online database, robust API functionality, and a user-friendly front-end interface. The secure database manages user credentials and real-time information updates, while the API supports key user interactions such as registration, login, and profile management. At its core, the application employs sophisticated algorithms for analyzing drug package sizes and evaluating costs, aimed at providing users with cost-effective drug replacement options. This seamless integration of database architecture, APIs, and front-end design enhances user experience by offering a streamlined process for accessing personalized, financially optimal drug replacements. The application's emphasis on security, efficiency, and precision in managing pharmaceutical data positions it as a significant tool in improving healthcare outcomes.
